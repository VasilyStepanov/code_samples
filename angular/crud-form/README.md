This code snippet demonstrates an example usage of the set of reusable angular components, written by me.
The code for the components themselves is not provided.

_eui-crud-form_ is based on top of _eui-form_, which is based on top of angular material.
My component allows you to create UI to Create, Read, Update, and Delete objects with minimum overhead.
Template driven approach allows you to rearrange fields on the form as you wish.

Below you can find screenshots of this form in different states.
